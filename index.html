                    <cite>Freddy Mercury</cite>
                </a>(born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991)[2] was a British
                singer-songwriter, who achieved international fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded
                as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage
                persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his
                theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

                Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended English-style boarding schools in
                India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled
                the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he
                formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for
                Queen, including "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody to Love", "We Are the Champions", "Don't
                Stop Me Now" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". His charismatic stage performances often saw him
                interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was
                a producer and guest musician for other artists.

                Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and posthumously featured on
                their final album, Made in Heaven (1995). He announced his diagnosis the day before his death, from
                complications from the disease, in 1991 at the age of 45. In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held
                at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018
                biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.

                Brian Harold May CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and astrophysicist
                who achieved fame as lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. May was a co-founder of Queen with lead
                singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor. His songwriting contributions helped Queen become one
                of the most successful bands in rock history.

                May previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university.
                After Queen's formation in 1970, bass player John Deacon joined to complete the line-up in 1971. They
                became one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and
                its single "Bohemian Rhapsody". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen played at some of the
                biggest venues in the world, including at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as
                a virtuoso musician. He was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work,
                often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special.[3] May wrote numerous hits for Queen,
                including "We Will Rock You", "I Want It All", "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Flash", "Hammer to Fall", "Save
                Me", "Who Wants to Live Forever", "Too Much Love Will Kill You", and "The Show Must Go On".

                Following the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of Made in
                Heaven (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)"
                (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and
                Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the
                seventh-greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the "100
                Greatest Guitarists of All Time".[5] In 2012, he was ranked the second-greatest guitarist in a Guitar
                World magazine readers poll.[6] In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a
                member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[7]

                Roger Meddows Taylor OBE (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, singer and multi-instrumentalist,
                best known as the drummer for the rock band Queen.[1] As a drummer, Taylor was recognised early in his
                career for his unique sound.[2] He was voted the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history
                in a listener poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.[3]

                As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the beginning, composing at least one
                track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three
                UK number ones ("These Are the Days of Our Lives",[4] "Innuendo" and "Under Pressure") and wrote a
                further five major hits ("Radio Ga Ga", "A Kind of Magic", "Heaven for Everyone", "Breakthru", and "The
                Invisible Man").[5] He was also the main writer on the international top-ten hit "One Vision", although
                the track is credited to the whole band.[6] He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger
                Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Kansas, Elton John, Gary Numan,
                Shakin' Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a
                producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail, and Magnum.

                John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired musician, best known for being the
                bassist for the rock band Queen. He composed several songs for the group, including Top 10 hits "You're
                My Best Friend", "Another One Bites the Dust", and "I Want to Break Free"; co-wrote "Under Pressure",
                "Friends Will Be Friends" and "One Vision"; and he was involved in the band's financial management.

                Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, before moving to
                study electronics at Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and
                electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar
                orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at
                least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar,
                keyboards and piano on Queen's studio work.

                After the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991 and the following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon
                performed only sporadically with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music industry
                in 1997 after recording "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)". He has not performed on any of the
                other projects that the two remaining members, Brian May and Roger Taylor, have put together.
